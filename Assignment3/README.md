## Part 1 Code Tests (6/10 pts)
- `last_digit`: 3/3
- `decimal_right_shift`: 3/3
- `sum_digits`: 0/4

## Part 2 Code Tests (10/20 pts)
- `verify`: 10/10
- `generate`: 0/10

## Part 1 Student Tests (6/10 pts)

TA Comments: 

## Part 2 Student Tests (0/20 pts)
- reasonably comprehensive tests for `verify`: 0/10
- reasonably comprehensive tests for `generate`: 0/10

TA Comments: 

## Part 1 Docstrings and Style (9/10 pts)
- docstring for `decimal_right_shift`: 2/2
- docstring for `sum_digits`: 2/2
- docstring for `main`: 2/2
- does not use string or list operations on `num`: 1/2
- `main` function takes a 3-digit number from user, prints the sum: 1/1
- `main` function checks if input is a 3-digit number: 1/1

TA Comments: Points back for wirting docs strings as comments. Next time write them as docsrtings

## Part 2 Docstrings and Style (18/20 pts)
- docstring for `verify`: 4/4
- docstring for `generate`: 4/4
- docstring for `main`: 4/4
- uses `last_digit` and `decimal_right_shift` instead of string/list operations: 0/2
- `main` function takes a 6-digit number from user, generates three numbers: 2/3
- `main` function checks if input is a 6-digit number: 0/3

TA Comments: Points back for wirting docs strings as comments. Next time write them as docsrtings
